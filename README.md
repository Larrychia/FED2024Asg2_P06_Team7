Introducing the new and upcomming trading marketplace platform , Mokesell ! Here at mokesell , we offer users a easy to use and a cheap marketplace for users to sell and buy items ! Users from all ages are welcomed , be it the younger generation , the working adults or the elderly . Age is not a limitation to our platform since it is that easy to navigate to each page of our platform . Users are welcomed to place anything on the marketplace that they deem worthy to be sold or wanted by others , as long as it is appropriate.

## Design Process 
During the project of designing our website , we constantly reminded and ask ourselves while implementing features , is this easy to use and will users want to use it ? There is no point of implementing a feature if it is too hard for users to learn how to use it or if it is not good. Our aim for our platform is to make a marketplace that is easily accessible and easy to navigate , on top of being a good feature that would enable customers to also easily sell and promote their own items.

For example , a seller on a marketplace like us , they would want the platform to be easy to navigate such that they can easily add their own items that they want to sell . Furthermore , they also want it to be able to display it on the marketplace for users to buy , afterall , placing a listing on the marketplace in the first place is to enable it to be sold . Buyers who access our platform will find it easy to use and buy items as it is very obviously highlighted across our page and can check the relative details of the items displayed on their screen

## Features

### Feature 1 : Create/Delete Listing
 Allows users who want to sell items on the platform to create listings with the relevant information like the name of the item , the price . Delete listing allows them to delete listings that they do not wish to put up on the marketplace anymore just by simply clicking the button 'delete listing'

### Feature 2 : Log in / Sign up

## Technologies used / Frameworks

-Bootstrap [https://startbootstrap.com/templates/ecommerce#google_vignette] -We made use of this boostrap template to make the designing of our platform easier -Lottie -We implement a lottie animation for our shop page and home such that their is time to load the page -Jquery -We also used Jquery to simplify DOM Manipulation -API -We made use alot of API calls such that we can store information and call out information from our database

## Assistive AI

-We made use of Github Copilot to help us with displaying the listings on homepage and shop page . It uses a script to manipulate the text in the html page such that it can keep looping all the listings stored in the Databse

## Credits

We took inspiration from carousell for our features such that our chat and profile is slightly similar to how carousell functions . It allowed us to simplify things and work on things quicker as we had an idea on where to start from
